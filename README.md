## Problem to Solve

In the digital age of 2024, securing sensitive information through encryption is vital. Unencrypted data stored on computers is vulnerable to unauthorized access, breaches, and malicious attacks, which can lead to severe privacy violations, identity theft, and financial loss. Despite the growing importance of cybersecurity, many files remain unprotected at rest.

This program, `scramble.c`, addresses such concerns by offering a simple yet effective command-line tool that encrypts files using multiple encryption techniques. By applying methods such as bitwise inversion, byte reversal, hashing, and byte splicing, Scramble ensures that the content of the files is altered, providing a layer of security for data at rest. This tool offers flexibility in encryption, allowing users to select the most suitable method for their use case. Designed for users who need a quick, accessible solution to protect files without the complexity of advanced cryptographic tools. It ensures that sensitive information is safeguarded, contributing to stronger overall data security practices.
