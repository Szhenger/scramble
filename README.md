## Problem to Solve

Given the digital landscape of 2024, securing sensitive information through encryption is more critical than ever. Unencrypted data is highly vulnerable to breaches, theft, and unauthorized access, which can lead to identity theft, financial loss, and privacy violations. Encryption mitigates these risks by ensuring that only authorized individuals can access sensitive data.

Despite the growing importance of cybersecurity, many files stored on computers today remain unencrypted, leaving them exposed to malicious actors. With increasing regulatory requirements around data protection—such as GDPR and HIPAA—encrypting files at rest has become a fundamental component of compliance and risk management for organizations handling sensitive data.

This program, `scamble.c`, addresses such concerns by offering a straightforward command-line tool that encrypts specified input files using reliable encryption algorithms, providing an easy and effective way to secure data at rest.
