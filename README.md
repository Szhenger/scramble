## Problem to Solve

Given the modern digital age in 2024, sensitive data stored on computers is vulnerable to breaches, theft, and unauthorized access. With growing cybersecurity threats and increasing regulatory requirements for data protection (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA), encrypting files at rest is crucial for safeguarding personal and corporate information. Files that remain unencrypted are easy targets for malicious actors, leading to identity theft, financial loss, and privacy violations.

While existing encryption tools are powerful, they can be overly complex for users who simply want a fast, effective solution to encrypt files. This is where `scramble` comes in—offering a lightweight, command-line encryption tool that enables users to protect their data with minimal effort.

`scramble` enables users to encrypt files by employing several encryption techniques, including bitwise inversion, byte reversal, and hashing. This flexibility ensures that files can be encrypted using an algorithm that best suits the user’s security requirements. The program is designed to be accessible and easy to integrate into automated workflows, making it an ideal solution for individuals and organizations alike.

## Background

Encryption is a fundamental tool for securing sensitive information in the digital age. By converting readable data into an unreadable format, encryption ensures that only authorized users can access the original content. In particular, file encryption is essential for protecting data at rest—files that are stored on a computer or device and not actively being used.

Scramble was developed as a lightweight command-line tool to provide a quick and easy way to encrypt files. It uses a range of basic encryption techniques to modify the content of the file, including:
